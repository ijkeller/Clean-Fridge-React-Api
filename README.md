### ðŸ“‹ List of API's

 Pull data into the application using an API  
  - [List of Public APIs](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis)  
  - [More APIs](https://github.com/abhishekbanthia/Public-APIs)  

Below is a non-exhaustive list of some free API's you can use. There are _many_ API's out there, however, so if you find one not on this list that you'd like to use, feel free! Please note that some may require signing up for an API key (e.g. the Marvel API).  

#### Games

* https://igdb.github.io/api/

### Your code must:

- Be properly indented.  
- Be written with semantic, camelCase JavaScript variable names.  
- Be written with kebab-case (dashes) CSS class names.  
- Contain no `console.log()` or commented out code in final version.  
- Use only React for DOM manipulation.  
- No pre-loaded `create-react-app` files or code.

## Necessary Deliverables


#### A Completed Project Proposal:
- Refer to the [project worksheet](/project-worksheet.md) file in this repo for structuring your Proposal.

#### For the project:
- A git repository hosted on GitHub, with a link to your hosted project, and **frequent** commits dating back to the very beginning of the project (YOUR APP SHOULD BE LOCATED IN A SEPARATE STANDING REPO. DO NOT build your app in this repository. YOU MUST initiate a new repo on your GitHub account.)

- Commit early, commit often:   Don't be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
